# Hospital Readmission Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository contains an **SQL query** for data cleaning and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a **hospital readmission dataset** using **Microsoft SQL Server**. It also includes a **dashboard** that visualizes key insights derived from the analysis.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**. You can access it here: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions).  

## Project Components  
- **SQL Query (`hospital Readmissions.sql`)** – A structured SQL script that performs data cleaning, handling missing values, and conducting exploratory analysis.  
- **Dashboard (`hospital_readmission_dashboard.twbx`)** – A visual representation of key findings.  
- **Insights (`insights.txt`)** – A summary of the main takeaways from the analysis.  

## Key Analysis Steps  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling null values, and formatting data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  EDA involved exploring the data to answer key quetions such as
  - Readmission rates of each age group admitted
  - Readmission rated based on medications
  - Readmission rates of patients based on their test results
  - Detecting relationships between readmission rates and the initial diagnosis
  - Identifying trends in hospital readmissions.  
  - Examining relationships between variables (e.g., patient demographics, diagnosis, length of stay).  
  - Finding potential risk factors for readmissions.  

## Tools Used  
- **SQL Server** – For data cleaning and EDA.  
- **Tableau** – For building the dashboard and visualizing insights.
